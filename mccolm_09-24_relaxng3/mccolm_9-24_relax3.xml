            <h2>FODDER FOR THE ALGORITHM GODS.</h2>
            <line> Creating consistent and constant social media content is something all folks,
                even the most experienced of us, struggle with.</line>
            <line>Folks often assume social media just “comes easily” to some people. While that may
                be true to a certain extent, it all comes with a ton of practice and observation.
                More often than not I’m staring blankly at my screen, hoping something funny comes
                to me. </line>
            <line>It’s difficult to list out my complete process when it comes to content creation,
                especially when inspiration can be on the fly. However I know some sort of starting
                point helps! So whether you’re new to this or a seasoned expert, I hope you find it
                useful.</line>

            <h2>Beginner Guides</h2>
            <line>If you’re just starting and want to understand how each platform works, one of the
                most underutilized resources are the ones social media platforms put out for
                creators creators - and they do have some good tips there. After all, they want
                people to use their platform! </line>

            <line>Of course, these put the platform in the best light possible and you’ll want to
                adapt these to fit your own strategy, but it’s still worth a peek if you are
                completely lost. (Tip: If you’re getting started as an indie, I’d ignore anything
                that is directed towards monetization and ads. Focus on your organic content
                creation first.) </line>
        </section>
        <section><h2>What Are Your Goals?</h2>
            <line>What you’re looking for with social media will inform the platforms you’re on, the
                type of content you make, and what you consider success.</line>
            <line>Most indie studios use it for awareness and discoverability - currently the hot
                thing is TikTok for discoverability, but as with anything, this can change at the
                drop of a hat depending on the algorithms. Other goals could be engagement, update
                awareness, customer service, etc. Whatever you decide, keep that in the back of your
                mind as we move forward with this post. </line>
        </section>
        <section><h2>How Do We Do Social Media “Well”?</h2>
            <line>The advice you generally see about social media is: “post quality content
                consistently”. Which sounds nice, but feels like throwing someone who doesn’t know
                how to swim into a pool and screaming “JUST SWIM GOOD TO SURVIVE”. (Okay maybe a bit
                extreme, but you catch my drift.) </line>
            <line>So before we dive too deep, let’s break down what “post quality content
                consistently” means.</line>
            <li><b>What is quality?</b> Quality is content that constantly engages or brings value
                (e.g. information, entertainment, knowledge) to your community. In order to know if
                it engages well, you need to know the platform - for instance the ratio of likes to
                follows, or the ratio of likes to views. It has to garner engagement organically and
                can’t incentivize engagement through external means such as contests, follow for
                follows, etc. </li>
            <li><b>What is consistency?</b> Consistency is the rate and regularity in which you post
                your content. Algorithms always tend to favour posting at least once per day, but
                that doesn’t necessarily need to occur for success - more that you do not disappear
                for weeks or months.</li>
            <line>But struggling with continually creating content is normal - this is someone’s
                full time job after all!</line>
        </section>
        <section><h2>What Platforms Should You Be On?</h2>
            <line>With ever evolving amounts of social platforms out there, many folks get
                overwhelmed thinking they have to be everywhere all at once. This isn’t true,
                especially if you’re busy handling a ton of other jobs! If you aren’t able to be on
                everything, here’s what to prioritize:</line>
            <li>Relatively easy for you to keep up with based on your skills and interests
                (explained further down in the post)</li>
            <li>Where your audience is</li>
            <li>Brings you some amount of excitement and joy</li>
            <line>Every choice you make has pitfalls - there’s no silver bullet social media
                platform even if it’s the hot new thing (e.g. TikTok). Heck, maybe BeReal is a great
                untapped social platform; the networks move so fast it’s hard to ever say that
                you’re doing it wrong, so long as you measure what works and you can keep it up.
            </line>
        </section>

        <section><h2>Splitting Accounts</h2>
            <line>Should you make a game specific account every single time, or consolidate all your
                games under one studio account? </line>
            <line>I usually recommend only having one studio specific account if you don’t have
                games with huge playerbases, don’t plan on constantly updating your games with new
                content, only work on one game at a time, or are a small team with limited
                resources. All of those best practices and algorithms that apply to one account?
                You’re going to need to do that with multiple different accounts and create content
                to fill the void - it’s not scalable in the long term unless you hire more. </line>
            <line>Game-specific accounts tend to be best for games with continual/constant updates
                or sizeable playerbases that need specific, streamlined communication (such as
                multiplayer games.) They often will have enough news or gameplay to share and can
                keep up with the daily grind of content creation. </line>
            <line> For some indie inspiration - <a href="https://twitter.com/SupergiantGames"
                    >Supergiant</a> changes their one account based on the game they have released
                at the time, and streamline it that way. Meanwhile, <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/BYG_Vancouver">Brace Yourself Games</a> splits their
                games into multiple accounts since they have multiple things going on at once. There
                are a ton of different examples of folks succeeding in either case, so in the end
                it’s up to you! </line>
        </section>
        <section><h2>How Do We Create Content? </h2>
            <line>How do we actually determine what content we make? Let’s imagine it as a flowchart
                for easy visualisation. </line>
            <line>At the top, you’ll have your game or studio, depending on what you’re doing. As an
                example, let’s use <a href="https://www.unpackinggame.com/">Unpacking</a>, a game I
                previously worked on since it feels a little like cheating if I use Among Us (as
                it’s a live ops game and constantly has updates.)</line>
            <line>Next, separate that into 3 big ideas that tie into your core. It can be anything
                that makes sense with your game! For now, let’s say my 3 main ideas for Unpacking
                content are: Game Development, Organization, and Personal Stories. So all content
                under these ideas have to relate to their specific pool.</line>
            <line>After that we can section each subtopic into content categories. These can be
                anything you like, so long as you can continually generate ideas from them.</line>
            <line>For instance, under “Game Development”, I put “Accessibility”. So as I start
                creating content ideas, I’ll look into the different ways I can show off Unpacking’s
                accessibility options. Under “Personal Stories”, I put down “Growth”. What kind of
                content can I create around how the characters grow up and how that reflects in
                their items when they move? What do they throw out? What do they leave behind? </line>
            <line>Using this framework, you can constantly refer back to it whenever you’re trying
                to figure out ideas for content. Nitpick the details of every part of the game and
                process - you never know what will be a hit. What could this plushie signify? What
                if I created a room full of toilet paper, which reflects the Great Toilet Paper
                Shortage of 2020? </line>
            <line>But how do we KNOW what content is good? Now you’re asking the right questions.
            </line>
        </section>
        <section><h2>How Do We Create Quality Content?</h2>
            <line>You always hear quality > quantity. Which is true, to a certain point. But how
                will you KNOW what quality is if you do not generate enough content to judge
                it?</line>
            <line>In order to see what quality is, the general rule is to track your engagement and
                follower counts, which you should definitely do. But every platform can have its own
                metrics you should look out for, such as TikTok have watch time. Either way, the
                backend analytics on each platform should give you some idea of what to
                track.</line>
            <line>Pooling content into distinct types will help you see a pattern in what works in
                terms of “quality”, and what doesn’t. Luckily for you, the flowchart from before is
                a great way to measure what is connecting with your audience, and refine it from
                there. </line>
            <line>For instance, here is a brief overview of the stats from my preliminary Among Us
                TikTok tracking: </line>
            <line>The categories are broader as I was grouping it for a <a
                    href="https://www.victoriatran.com/writing/among-us-tiktok">previous blog
                    post</a>, but you get the idea. Seeing what’s most exciting to your players will
                help you determine where to go.</line>
        </section>
        <section><h2>But Wait!</h2>
            <line>Engagement counting isn’t enough. We want the qualitative aspect of it too! That’s
                part of the beauty of our work - paying attention to both numbers and sentiment
                helps us grow better in the long term. </line>
            <line>What are folks SAYING about your content? What words do they use to describe your
                game? Are they confused about something? Are they actually engaging with your
                content? Are you giving them an opportunity to? Who do you see coming back? Are they
                angry at your content? Are they laughing? </line>
            <line>We find the answers to these questions by paying attention and self reflecting on
                what we put out there. We learn what words to use, we know the tone, we know what
                sounds snappy or bloated. This all stems from observation and knowing how to
                critically engage with language!</line>
            <line>For instance, some people have mentioned being afraid of a “silence brand” moment
                if they try to be funny. The way I put it is that you’ll only get these moments when
                you act in a way that is inauthentic to you, your values, or your interests. People
                are perceptive enough to get when you are faking it.</line>
            <line>As a personal example, I think a ton of the older memes are hilarious. Don’t get
                me wrong - I’ll hop on the latest trends, but nothing beats a finely aged meme. I’m
                lucky to work with <a href="https://twitter.com/thisishannako">Hannako Lambert</a>,
                who creates a lot of our social art. We’ll often come up with something to post
                together, and sometimes these are very old references that would be labelled a
                “silence brand” moment. But we’ve always gotten away with it.</line>
            <line>I ALWAYS make sure to take extra time to reply to as many comments as I can after
                I post any of these images. I laugh with people, respond to cringing with
                tongue-in-cheek humour, and I lean into how ridiculous the post is.</line>
            <line>And I try to jump on trends, I also don’t worry if I see one that I don’t find
                amusing or have an idea for. I’d rather skip it entirely than try and force myself
                to be entertaining or go against my values. (For instance, I was not a huge fan of
                the Adam Levine sexting meme.) </line>
            <line>The point of me saying this isn’t “you should post memes” or “just be funny lol??”
                - the point is that you do not have to fear what brings you joy. Share your
                enthusiasm with your audience.</line>
            <line>In essence, while we do want to narrow down our content to be of quality and
                interest to our audience, we only know how to do this by posting content again and
                again and again to see what works and define what quality is to us. </line>

            <h2>Playing To Your Strengths</h2>
            <line>Assuming you don’t have an entire team dedicated to content creation, coming up
                with ideas and executing it is still going to take a lot of work. The best way to
                get inspired to create content is to play according to your own abilities and
                interests. </line>
            <line>So if you’re stronger at…</line>
            <li>Writing, then try: <bullet>Blog posts and articles <ul>Take quotes and turn them

                of these well. It’s still hard!!!” Uhh yeah! It better be! Again, this is someone’s
                full time job and specialization. Some people just HATE making content and struggle
                to do it. This is normal. You’re doing great. You don’t need to push out daily
                content, but you do need to try (or hire someone!)</line>

        <section><h2>Keeping It Sustainable</h2>
            <line>Phewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww. Now one of the most important things we need
                to know is how we will sustain ourselves. Everyone has their own ways of preventing
                burn out, but as someone who has to do this on the daily, here are ways I keep this
                sustainable:</line>
            <li>Bulk create content. If you’re having a day where you’re feeling particularly
                inspired or motivated, create as much content as you can within your given
                timeframe. Set aside time in your week and have a day where you focus on creating
                content. I recommend having at least a week’s worth of content ready in your
                backpocket in case you ever have a time where you’re just creatively drained. </li>
            <li>Draft like you’ve never drafted before. Sometimes you’ll have ideas but not enough
                energy or brainspace to make it work. Tuck that idea in your pocket for later. Film
                TikToks when you get the idea and save them as a draft and return to them when you
                have the energy and time to flesh them out and refine them (for instance, I will
                film just a blank wall and write what I want to happen, with the sound, and save it
                in my TikTok drafts for later.) Have a secret bank of tweet drafts that are just
                waiting to be refined and tweeted. Save WIP art or bugs from the team. Have weird
                content that was mishmashed together in PhotoShop. Have an old meme you saved in a
                folder. All of these ideas are seeds that can grow into plants, if you give them
                some time and effort. Sometimes it’s easier to tend to them rather than find all new
                ideas!</li>
            <li>Don’t feel pressured to be a part of every trend. Do you need to join the bandwagon
                on everything that goes viral? Nah. There’s always another thing that’ll come
                around, and if this one isn’t inspiring you, isn’t personally amusing to you, or
                against your own values - skip it! No need to justify it. </li>
            <li>Make small sustainable goals. Some folks like having goals for themselves, which is
                totally fine. Just make sure it’s at a sustainable pace for you. Best practices will
                say post 3x daily on TikTok, but that’s worthless if it’s going to burn you out by
                week 1. Instead, find a cadence that you are able to keep up or bulk create content
                for when you really need to pump up the promo. Algorithms are good to follow, but it
                doesn’t mean that if you DON’T post daily you’re trash.</li>
            <li>Have an inspiration list. Follow accounts or other studios that are doing cool fun
                things! There’s no harm in being inspired by each other, just be respectful of it. </li>
            <li>Take a vacation goddamnit!!! Set vacation days and get away from social media when
                you can. Stick to it! Consume content instead of just making it all the time! </li>
        </section>
        <section><h2>The End</h2>
            <line>I hope this helps frame content creation in a more understandable format and makes
                your life just a teeny bit easier. It’s something everyone struggles with, and the
                grind of feeding the algorithm gods can feel like a herculean effort. You’re not
