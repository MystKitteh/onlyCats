            <h2>Matador 64: Scourge of the Meta</h2>
            <img src="images/matador.jpg" />
            <p>Matador’s name originates from the video game called <a
                href="https://www.destinythegame.com/d1">Destiny</a>. Around the time of his
                adoption, I had been playing loads of Destiny, and I was still trying to come up with a
                name. My brother suggested Matador as a joke since that was my most used weapon, but I
                wanted more meaning than just some gun. Most of it ties to Destiny, but it’s also a
                little play to Nintendo 64.</p>
            <p>Look at how <u><i>handsome</i></u> he is!</p>

            <h2>Nyx, Goddess of the Night</h2>
            <img src="images/nyx.jpg" />
            <p>Nyx got her name similarly situation to how Matador got his name. I had been playing <a
                href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades/">Hades</a> a lot around the time
                of her adoption and wanted to give her a name that would suit her. Nyx is the daughter
                of chaos and the mother of night. That fits her personality to the tee!</p>
